# Battle-Super-Legends-Super-Edition
OGPC Project 2018

  This game is called Battle Super Legends: Super Edition. It is called that because we believe that it really encapsulates the spirit of love, peace, and self-expression. In this game one can play as multiple characters with different abilities and different skills allowing them to entirely eviscerate whichever enemy lay in their path. This ability to choose is symbolic of our belief of how important it is for people to think freely and choose to better themselves on a daily basis. This character will be able to traverse different worlds and collect different armor as the story progresses. The ability to grow as a player and as a character is very important to us, but more important is to grow as a person; to take concrete steps to learn from one's own mistakes and change as time passes and people enter and exit our lives is crucial, we believe that this feature will spark that kind of growth and foster self-love throughout. Another feature in our game is the random map generation, differently built stages every time you play the game. This represents the cold reality that nothing is in our control and as humans we must accept the morbidly looming truth that demise is inevitable and nothing matters.
